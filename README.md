# Commercial-House-Pricing-in-Beijing

Hi all!

This is a personal final project for a class, Regression Analysis in Management Research. I extracted house information from anjuke.com using Selenium and re in Python and implemented variance analysis using R.

I learned web crawler methods from the book, Financial Data  Mining and Analysis Using Python, which is written by Yutao Wang. So the case study of Baidu News Report in the book is also  included as the exercise part in the code.

Contents:
    Final_Code.ipynb -- web scrawler code in Jupyter Notebook
    Final_code.R     -- variance analysis code in R
    Final_data.xlsx  -- data extracted using Final_Code.ipynb and used in Final_code.R

Thank you,

Yitong Li
