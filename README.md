# Commercial-House-Pricing-in-Beijing
This is a personal final project for a class, Regression  Analysis in Management Research. I extracted house information  from anjuke.com using Selenium and re in Python and implemented  variance analysis using R. I learned web crawler methods from the book, Financial Data  Mining and Analysis Using Python, which is written by Yutao Wang. So the case study of Baidu News Report in the book is also  included as the exercise part in the code.  Yitong Li 11/2019
